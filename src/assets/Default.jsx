Another cold morning in New York. The city never really sleeps, but I wish I had. My alarm goes off at 6:30 AM, but I hit snooze—twice. Finally drag myself out of bed, make a quick coffee, and stare out at the skyline from my tiny apartment window. Twenty-five, decent job, good salary—on paper, I should be happy. But something feels… off.

The subway is packed as always. Strangers lost in their own worlds, headphones in, avoiding eye contact. Work is the usual cycle of emails, meetings, and pretending to care. I should be grateful, but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m meant for something more.

Evenings blur into Netflix, takeout, and scrolling through other people’s seemingly perfect lives. Everyone looks like they’re chasing something, building something. And me? I feel stuck.

Maybe I’ll start writing again. Maybe I’ll take a different route home. Maybe I just need to stop waiting.

Tomorrow, I’ll do one thing differently. Because I don’t want to just exist—I want to live.`;
